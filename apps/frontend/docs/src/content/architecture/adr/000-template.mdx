## 1. Context

This section describes the **technical problem** or **challenge** we are facing. Why is this decision necessary?

- Describe the current system scenario (involved components, existing constraints).
- Identify the driving forces (business requirements, technical limitations, technical debt).
- Keep this section concise and objective.

> _Example:_ Our current authentication system (module X) relies on a legacy provider scheduled for shutdown in 6 months. We need to migrate to a new provider that supports OAuth 2.0 and can be seamlessly integrated into our _Identity Bounded Context_. The main constraints are the timeline and maintaining zero impact on the user experience.

## 2. Decision

This section records the **final** technical decision made.

- State the decision clearly and explicitly.
- Briefly explain why this option was chosen over the alternatives.

> _Example:_ We have decided to implement **Auth0** as the new identity provider. The `Identity` module will be refactored to use the OpenID Connect protocol with the new Auth0 SDKs. The session token will be exchanged for a JWT issued by Auth0 during the login flow.

## 3. Consequences

What are the immediate and long-term implications of this decision? List the impacts clearly.

### ➕ Positive Consequences (Gains)

- [E.g., Reduction of technical debt in the authentication module.]
- [E.g., Native support for Single Sign-On (SSO) with reduced effort.]
- [E.g., Enhanced security due to automatic provider updates.]

### ➖ Negative Consequences (Costs/Risks)

- [E.g., Additional financial cost for the Auth0 license.]
- [E.g., Estimated development time of 4 weeks for the migration.]
- [E.g., Risk of incompatibility with third-party legacy integrations (module Z).]

## 4. Alternatives Considered

This section is crucial for providing context to the decision. List the options that were evaluated and the reasons why they were discarded.

### Alternative A: [Name of Alternative]

- **Description:** [E.g., Using self-hosted Keycloak.]
- **Reason for Rejection:** [E.g., While open-source and free, the operational cost for maintenance, scalability, and security patching is too high for our current team.]

### Alternative B: [Name of Alternative]

- **Description:** [E.g., Developing an in-house identity provider from scratch.]
- **Reason for Rejection:** [E.g., The security risk and the time required to reach feature parity with market solutions are unacceptable. This is not our *Core Domain*.]
