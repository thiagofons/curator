# Domain Model

The Domain Model serves as our **Ubiquitous Language** and the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for all core business logic within the Curator platform. It defines the entities, their relationships, and the scope of responsibility for each service, following the principles of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**.

## Bounded Contexts Diagram

The diagram below visualizes the key entities in our domain, grouped by their respective **Bounded Contexts**. Each Bounded Context roughly corresponds to a **primary microservice** in our system.

## 🏗️ Entities by Bounded Context

For each Bounded Context, we list the main entities and what they represent in terms of business logic:

### 1. Identity

| **Admin**       | Subtype of User with elevated privileges for managing users, content, and system configurations. |

### 2. Roadmap Context

**Responsibility:** Managing the creation, structure, and lifecycle of all Roadmaps. This is our Core Domain.

| **AIGeneratedRoadmap**   | Subtype of Roadmap automatically generated by an AI model. Has stricter editing rules.         |
| **Step**                 | Base entity for a single step within a Roadmap.                                                |
| **MediaStep**            | Subtype of Step that includes media (videos, images) or external links.                        |
| **InfoStep**             | Subtype of Step that includes only textual information or links to internal documentation.     |

### 3. Interaction

**Responsibility:** Managing the asynchronous interactions of users with content (Roadmaps).

| Entity       | Description                                                             |

## 🔗 Key Relationships

The diagram illustrates the following essential relationships:

- **Creation:** A `User` is the creator of a `Roadmap` (One-to-Many Relationship).
- **Composition:** A `Roadmap` is composed of one or more `Step`s (Aggregation/Composition Relationship).
- **Interactions:** `User` and `Roadmap` interact via the `Favorite` and `Comment` entities.
- **Authentication:** The `User` is linked to the `Login` entity to manage session state.
