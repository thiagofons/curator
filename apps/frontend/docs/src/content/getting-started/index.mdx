# Getting Started: Core Monorepo Commands

Welcome to the Curator monorepo! To keep our **Developer Experience (DX)** pillar strong, we've built a fast and efficient development environment.

This environment is powered by two key tools:

- **pnpm:** Our package manager. It's extremely fast and saves disk space by using a content-addressable store.
- **Turborepo:** Our high-speed build system and task runner. This is the "brain" of our monorepo.

Turborepo understands the dependencies between all our `apps` and `packages`. It ensures that when you run a command (like `build`), you _only_ build what has actually changed, saving you massive amounts of time.

> **The Golden Rule:** All commands in this guide must be run from the **root** of the monorepo (the `curator/` folder), not from within an app's folder (like `curator/apps/frontend/docs`).

---

## 1. Installation: The First Command

Before you can run anything, you need to install all dependencies and link the local packages together.

```bash
pnpm install
```

This single command reads the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file, finds every project in `apps/*` and `packages/*`, and installs all their dependencies in a single, shared `node_modules` folder at the root.

## 2. The Core "Big 4" Commands

These are the main scripts you'll use daily. They are defined in the root `package.json` and are powered by `pnpm turbo run ...`.

| What does it do                    | Command           |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Running Locally (dev)              | `turbo run dev`   |
| Building for Production (build)    | `turbo run build` |
| Running Tests (test)               | `turbo run test`  |
| Linting and Formatting Code (lint) | `turbo run lint`  |

## 3. The Superpower: Filtering (`--filter`)

After a while, you'll notice that `pnpm dev` starts every app, which can be slow and noisy.

The `--filter` flag lets you run a task for only a specific app or package.

**Example 1: Run only the `docs` app**

If you are only working on documentation, use this:

```bash
pnpm dev --filter=@frontend/docs
```

**Example 2: Build only the identity-service**

If you only changed the Identity service, you don't need to rebuild the docs.

```bash
pnpm build --filter=@backend/identity-api
```
